# Orthanc

My containerised development machine that installs all the tools that I need to do development on a number of repos/projects/general fun coding.

## Notes
- This is emulating a machine, whereby it installs all the tools for local development.
- The `Development` folder can be used to clone the projects you want to work on, or to create test projects etc.
